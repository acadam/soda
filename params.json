{"name":"SoDA","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to SoDA.\r\n\r\nSoDA is a library and toolchain designed to make dependency analysis, test prioritization or test selection on your test suite.\r\n\r\nThe SoDA library contains the necessary data structures to efficiently store a coverage matrix for multiple test cases, the results of your test suite execution of multiple revisions and the changes in your program during multiple revisions. These data structures can be used to implement prioritization or other dependence analysis related algorithms.\r\n\r\nWe are planning to release evaluation tools that will measure the quality of the implemented algorithms. \r\n\r\nVisit our [GitHub page](https://github.com/sed-szeged/soda) or our [wiki](https://github.com/sed-szeged/soda/wiki/SoDA) page to get more information about the project.\r\n\r\nThe library is released under LGPLv3 license.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nSoDA is created and maintained by the [Department of Software Engineering](http://www.sed.hu), [University of Szeged](http://www.u-szeged.hu). \r\n\r\nIf you would like to contribute to the project, create an issue at our GitHub page or send a pull request. Every contribution is welcome!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
