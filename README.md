### Welcome to SoDA.

SoDA is a library and toolchain designed to make dependency analysis, test prioritization or test selection on your test suite.

The SoDA library contains the necessary data structures to effeciently store a testcase coverage matrix, the results of your test suite of multiple revisions and the changes in your program during multiple revisions. These data structures can be used to implement prioritization or other dependence analysis related algorithms. 

We are planning to release some evaluation tools that will measure the quality of the implemented algorithms. 

Visit our [wiki](https://github.com/sed-szeged/soda/wiki/SoDA-wiki) page to get more information about the project.

The library is released under LGPL license.
