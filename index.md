### Welcome to SoDA.

The aim of the SoDA (Software Development Analysis framework) library, toolset and program
repository is to provide researchers and practitioners a framework with which various
code coverage-based analyses can be performed in a unified environment, and which can be
applied to large programs and test suites efficiently, and without limitations on programming language,
granularity and coverage criteria.

#### Repository

We provide a [program repository](/repository.html) with tests and prepared analysis scripts.
The repository contains the SoDA binary data files of various programs and
already made measurements, which can be used for research purposes.
